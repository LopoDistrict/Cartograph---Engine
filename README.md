# Cartograph-Engine
I try to create a mobile game engine in javascript/electonjs, cpp, and python for a video game idea that i got.

# Main Idea
Basically, I wanted to make a post apocalyptic rpg based on localization (the RPG would take place in our real world, with quests, locations and dungeons set in our world, a bit like Pokemon GO).

To realize this project, I first told myself that it would be interesting to start from scratch, while still having some libraries with which to build my mobile game. 

To explain the structure quickly, I'm using cpp for complex calculations such as inventory management, positioning of dungeons/quests and everything linked to geolocation. I also use python to render the map using the follium library, all in the backend. In fact, on the front end I use electronjs for all rendering, but also for less complex calculations such as turn-based attacks.

# Problem
My main problem was that I hadn't realized that electronjs couldn't make mobile applications and that it was impossible for NOdeJS to run on mobile devices. Clearly, I was stupid and thought it would be a good idea, the project is in a state of stagnation trying to find an alternative or a time to rewrite all the code in a more versatile language/library.

You can ask me anything you like about this project, or even reuse it if you like (the code and script are a mess :/).
